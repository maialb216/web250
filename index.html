	<p>The purpose of this site is to serve as a semester-long project, done by <a href="introduction.html">Maia Bailey</a> for WEB250-N801, taught by Professor von Briesen.
	The site will update and expand over the course of the class to show my growth and better understanding of both front and back-end coding.</p>
